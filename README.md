Inspiration
For millions of people living with Parkinson’s, ALS, and other mobility challenges, something as simple as sending a message can feel overwhelming. Most digital assistants rely on voice or typing, but what if those barriers didn’t exist at all?

That’s why we created Blink AI—not just another assistant, but an intelligent system powered by a groundbreaking translation algorithm that converts blinks into text, opening a world of possibilities for those who need it most.

Because communication should never be limited by physical ability. Everyone deserves a way to express their thoughts, ask questions, and stay connected—and now, they can do it with just a blink.

What it does
Blink AI detects intentional blinks, measures their duration and sequence, translates them into Morse code, converts that Morse code into text, and then sends the final text to an AI assistant to generate a response.

How It Works:
Blink Detection: The Blink AI algorithm tracks intentional blinks, filtering out natural blinking to avoid false inputs.

Blink Interpretation: It analyzes the duration and frequency of each blink, translating them into dots and dashes in Morse code.

Morse Code Conversion: The Morse code sequence is instantly decoded into readable text, forming a structured message.

AI Processing: The translated text is sent to an external AI assistant, which processes it like a standard input and generates a response.

Response Delivery: The AI assistant’s response is sent back to the user, enabling a smooth, natural exchange of information.

What It Unlocks:
Ask Questions & Get Answers – Interact with AI assistants and receive real-time responses.
Send Messages with a Blink – Communicate effortlessly without touch or voice.
Control Smart Devices – Operate technology hands-free with precise blink commands.
Express Thoughts Clearly – A powerful tool for individuals with limited mobility, turning intention into action.
Blink AI doesn’t just detect blinks—it translates them into a language AI can understand, creating a seamless bridge between human expression and technology.

No voice. No keyboard. Just a blink.

Challenges we ran into
Implementing the Morse Code Algorithm Accurately – Converting blinks into Morse code required precision. The algorithm had to reliably distinguish between short and long blinks, recognize intentional sequences, and filter out involuntary blinks. Fine-tuning timing and detection thresholds was crucial to prevent errors and misinterpretations.

Integrating the AI Assistant – Once Morse code was translated into text, we needed to ensure the AI assistant could process the input accurately and return relevant responses. This required optimizing how text was formatted, transmitted, and made compatible with various AI models to provide fast, meaningful, and user-friendly interactions.

Balancing Speed and Accuracy– The system needed to be both fast and precise. If it processed blinks too quickly, it risked misreading input; too slowly, and it would feel unresponsive. Achieving the right balance required extensive testing, adjustments, and optimizations.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We developed a fully functional prototype that accurately translates blinks into real-time AI-powered communication.

We created one of the first Morse-code-based blink detection systems, turning blinks into a seamless way to interact with AI.

We empowered individuals with a new way to communicate, proving that technology can be for everyone.

What we learned
Technology should work for people—not the other way around. If it’s not intuitive, it won’t be used.

Small improvements make a big difference. Even a 0.1-second boost in response time completely changed the user experience.

Good technology isn’t about making things complicated—it’s about making life easier. The best solutions take away barriers, not add them.

What's next for BlinkAI
Making Blink Detection Even Smarter – Improving accuracy so it recognizes blinks more naturally, refines Morse code translation, and responds even faster.

Helping Blink AI Learn From Users – Fine-tuning the system so it adapts to each person’s unique blinking style, making interactions feel effortless.

Expanding AI Compatibility – Ensuring Blink AI works smoothly with different AI assistants and platforms, giving users more choices.

Bringing Blink AI to More People – Optimizing it for more devices so anyone who needs it can use it, no matter their setup.

Real-World Testing & Feedback – Working directly with users, accessibility experts, and healthcare providers to keep improving Blink AI where it matters most.
